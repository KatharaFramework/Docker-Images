# `kathara/nested` Image

This is a beta version of the `kathara/nested` image, a Docker image that contains itself, `kathara/frr`, and Kathará!

Beware that this beta version only builds the image corresponding to your host platform.
Support for multi-platform will be added in the final version.

A proper README with a bit of explanation will be added in the future.

How to build:
1. Run `make all` and wait.

In order to use it, you need a Kathará version compatible with nesting. 
For now, you can find it in the [`feature-inception` branch](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara/tree/feature-inception).
